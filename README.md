I'm a Developer based in India, passionate about building interactive and functional web experiences.

For the past few years, I've been working with modern web technologies, including React, JavaScript, and CSS, to create engaging user interfaces. I focus on clean code, minimal design, and smooth user experiences across various projects from racing games to corporate websites.

Currently expanding my skillset into backend development to become a full-stack developer. I believe in continuous learning and building projects that solve real problems.
