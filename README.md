## About Me

I am Arghya, a developer from Kolkata who enjoys building websites and applications that solve real problems. Coding for me is a mix of logic, patience, and small breakthroughs that make all the effort feel worth it.

When I am not working on software, I enjoy building robots and exploring various hardware projects. I have built more than eight robots, won two hackathons, and completed several gigs. I hope that one day I can explain to my parents what coding actually is.
